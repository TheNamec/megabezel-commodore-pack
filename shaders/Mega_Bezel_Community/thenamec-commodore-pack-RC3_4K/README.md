[1] INTRO
=========
Emulation is evolving from retro-nostalgia to enhanced retro-gaming, leading to modern ways to enjoy our imperfect memories and bringing back this strange “I’ve been there, but something’s different” feeling.

Somebody says modern emulation is missing that ancient connection between the gamer and the original hardware: to me, gameplay is the king but... when it comes to the systems of my youth, retro nostalgia kicks in.

I'm an Italian graphic artist and this is my love letter to Commodore devices: a special graphic pack for use with RetroArch and HSM Mega Bezel Reflection Shader.

[2] FEATURES   
============

[2.2] ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS
----------------------------

I personally draw my digital illustrations with a particular care for accessibility, usability and originality of concepts and design, while keeping quality at a professional level.

- Vector-based original illustrations rendered at 300dpi
- Bicubic sharper resampling from 300dpi to 72dpi for crispy, super-sampling anti-aliased visuals
- 16:9 aspect ratio, horizontal, optimized for 1080p and 4k resolutions
- Adaptive support for horizontal ultrawide displays
- Photorealistic-like hand drawn shading
- Historically based details taken from actual hardware, advertising and manuals
- Remixed familiar elements (ever dreamt about integrated data units?)
- Perceptive dis-proportion between elements and fan-based branding
- Retro-modding original alternative designs 😉

 Some special "visual mods" are included to enhance retrogaming experience:

- `DATASSETTE LIGHTBULB` nothing is better than an old incandescence bulb casting light on yout audiocassette game compilation
- `EMBEDDED DATA DEVICE` floppy disk drives and datassette are embedded in the chassis for a compact, all-in-one design
- `AMIGA 1200SYNTH` is an original concept for an advanced Synthwave Amiga, equipped with a dark chassis, backlit keyboard, embedded multi-floppy data simulator and optical disk drive. A little cyber, a little punk

ℹ️ *Note: `AMIGA 1200SYNTH` is also available as FS-UAE Amiga emulator theme, sporting exclusive advanced features:
- Blinking LED indicators
- Functional multi-floppy data simulator
- Disk presence switches, track display, access notification
- Audio indicator
- Basic curvature and scanlines postprocessing effects

For more info about my FS-UAE themes visit <https://retrogamingpacks.blogspot.com/p/features-fs-uae-amiga-themes.html>.

[2.3] ZERO-CONFIG PRESETS
-------------------------

The main objectives of Retrogaming Packs project is to make **the best emulation visuals accessible to everyone**.

A huge effort was invested in developing pre-made configuration files, called 'Shader Presets' in Libretro jargon, to expose the full potential with near to zero user-side setup.

Each Retrogaming Pack includes ready-to-go configuration files (presets) with a combination of alternatives:
- Gaming systems and retro scenes
- CRT displays, TVs and monitors
- Curved and flat tubes, bezels and frames
- Display framing with levels of zoom
- Day and night ambient lightning
- NTSC signal vs crystal clear RGB
- Performance solutions

[2.4] PERFORMANCE SOLUTIONS
--------------------------

Retrogaming Packs enable graphic caching by default, getting a consistent performance with SMOOTH-ADVANCED, ADVANCED or STANDARD presets. Nevertheless, POTATO alternatives provide accessibility for less powerful machines.

- `ADVANCED (ADV)` is a full customizable experience with modular layouts for display scaling and positioning, glass reflections and ambient lightning. This is the way to go to have customization flexibility and performance, with high visual quality and unaltered original artworks
- `SMOOTH-ADVANCED` enhances the experience with post-processing passes: ScaleFX smooth resample, fast sharpen, fake scanlines, MDAPT de-dithering for pseudo-transparencies. Post-processing produces higher quality 2D game artworks, while maintaining authentic CRT texture and a little graininess. Truth is: once you taste SMOOTH-ADV, you will never go back!
- `STANDARD (STD)` is a faster alternative to ADVANCED and includes CRT postprocessing effects like color grading and display scaling/positioning personalization 
- `POTATO (POT)` is an insanely performing overlay solution with easy-go CRT masking based on lighter shaders

ℹ️ *Note: remember that if you find my shader presets to be too heavy for your rig, you can toggle unwanted features and save your custom simple-presets.*

[2.5] MODULAR DISPLAYS
----------------------

Because of real-life Commodore displays being widely cross-platform compatible, Retrogaming Packs lets you combine classic displays with all systems: I myself used a C1084 monitor on my Amiga 500 in the days, while lots of people used it as an high-end monitor for C64!

SMOOTH-ADVANCED, ADVANCED and STANDARD presets let you choose from a wide catalogue of monitors & TVs to combine with each gaming system.

POTATO presets leverage on pre-baked overlays for high performance, meaning you can choose from at least two alternatives, being them curved and flat variants.

You are free to choose from an array of fully modelled classic devices including:
- COMMODORE: Commodore 1201 Monochrome, Commodore 1702, Commodore 1902, Commodore 1084, Commodore 1084S-D1, Commodore 1084S-D2 CDTV Black Edition
- BEZELTRON CRT SERIES: Philips 21pt3326-v7
- PROCEDURAL MEGA BEZELS: light (beige, cream) and dark (black, darkgray) variants with per-system custom decals.

[2.6] DISPLAY CURVATURE
-----------------------

Which CRT display would you choose for gaming: a modern FLAT one, or a classic CURVED device? The latter has an undeniable magic, but may inherit shortcomings like moire/scanlines artifacts, aliasing, and the infamous rainbow effect. On the other side, FLAT screens has always been the top quality choice, but may be missing that vintage feeling.

So I decide to develop both variations for each display preset for you to choose from:
- `CURVED` simulates the typical barrel distortion from CRT surface. Bezel and frame are realistically arranged to minimize overscan. May introduce artifacts.
- `FLAT` straightens things out, making pixels perfectly orthogonal like expensive last-gen CRTs and modern LCD/OLED panels. Prevents artifacts.

[2.7] SCALABLE FRAMING
----------------------

Retrogaming Packs come with zero-config presets for you to enjoy the most comfortable framing: textures layers logic will automatically take care of resizing for the best gaming experience.

- `NEAR SCALING` is a fine-tuned sweet spot between gaming area and a zoomed-in display, the ideal solution for gaming
- `NORMAL SCALING` full display chassis is visible, trading a smaller gaming area for a beautiful retro-scenery
- `INTEGER SCALING` automatic display zoom for cleanest pixels and less artifacts

[2.8] AMBIENT LIGHTNING
-----------------------

Let your retrogames shine! *Day lightning* makes you enjoy a full lit room showing all accurately rebuilt graphics details.

If you prefer to turn off the lights, *Night lightning* is easier on your eyes as it simulates a soft, warm lit room full with LEDs lightning from your retrogaming systems.

System presets come with day and night variants for each display out-of-the-box so you can instantly choose the best solution with zero configuration.

Each display comes with it's own lightning and LEDs layer for a realistic experience fine tuned for both day and night lightning.

ℹ️ *Note: you can customize ambient lightning via a single percentage parameter and create your custom presets. It's just that easy!*


[2.9] INTRO SEQUENCES
----------------------

You can enjoy an animated intro sequence, full with old-school statics and pixelated per-system and per-model logos, paired with each preset for a fully immersive retro nostalgia.

ℹ️ *Note: to use this feature you have to use one of the RetroArch auto-loading methods, please refer to the [presets loading](#44-presets-loading) section.*

Common presets customizations for game-tailored experience include:

- Fixing overscan and centering for each game. PAL/NTSC adaptions, damn you!
- Fiddling with display scaling, position and aspect ratio
- Tuning ambient lightning and reflection settings
- Invest countless hours in visual configuration instead of happily gaming 

RetroArch really is a swiss-knife for customization, so go on with the reading!


[4.1] BEFORE YOU START CUSTOMIZING (IMPORTANT!) 
-----------------------------------------------

⚠️ First of all, activate the `Simple Preset` feature to automatically save a custom preset containing parameters values, thus preserving default shader preset.

Enable `Simple Presets`:
> - Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save set `Simple Presets` to `ON`

ℹ️ *Note: If you don't enable `Simple Preset`, your customizations may destroy the original presets and bad things may happen. Or maybe not. I wouldn't risk it* 😰
  
[4.2] CUSTOMIZE VIA QUICK MENU
------------------------------

`Quick menu` lets you customize via gamepad by increasing/decreasing values for shader parameters. It's ok for trivial changes, but can fell a little slow for complex activities and requires switching between the `quick menu` and gameplay are to see the changes.

Adjust shader parameters:
> 1) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Shader Parameters -> Parameters
> 2) Adjust settings to your preference
> 3) Quick Menu -> Resume and enjoy your customized game

To save your settings:
> 4) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Choose one option

To determine which saving option is the better for you, please refer to the [presets loading](#44-presets-loading) paragraph.

ℹ️ *Note: unless you save your custom settings, you will lose all of them when you close the game or quit RetroArch!* 
  
  
[4.3] CUSTOMIZE VIA DESKTOP MENU
--------------------------------

`Desktop menu` lets you customize shader parameters via sliders and input boxes with mouse and keyboard. You can use side-by-side distinct game window and parameters panel and see the changes in real-time. `Desktop Menu` is the ideal tool to quickly learn parameters effects and to develop deep customizations.

Load a game, you better choose one without time limits: 😉

> 1) Exit full screen by pressing `f` key
> 2) Windows-> select `Toggle Desktop Menu`
> 3) Desktop Menu window opens up, View-> select `Shaders`
> 4) Shaders Panel opens up, press 'Load' button, choose `Load`
> 5) Navigate to the shader you want to customize, select it and press `Open` button
> 6) Use the Shaders panel to customize settings, you can view the results applied to the game in real time in the RetroArch main window

To save your settings:

> 7) In Shaders Panel, press `Save` button and choose one option
> 8) Re-enable full screen by selecting Retroarch main window and pressing `f` key

To determine which saving option is the better for you, please refer to the [presets loading](#44-presets-loading) paragraph.

ℹ️ *Note: unless you save your custom settings, you will lose all of them when you close the game or quit RetroArch!* 

[4.4] PRESETS LOADING
---------------------

For use with multi-system cores (a single core emulates more than one system), you have different choices to save and load your presets: do some experimentation and find the one that best fits your needs!
  
### [4.4.1] MANUAL LOADING
**************************

> I'd like to manually load a preset each time you launch a game

- PRO: you are free to load whatever shader preset you like, regardless of game, core or path
- CON: you have to reload the shader preset each time you start a content

To save your settings:
> - Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Save Shader preset as... -> give a name and save
> - (Next time you boot a game) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Load Shader Preset -> choose a preset

ℹ️ *Note: Custom preset are saved in the `/shaders` folder.*
  
  
### [4.4.2] CORE PRESET LOADING
*******************************

> I'd like to autoload presets each time you use a specific core (i.e. `PUAE core`)

- PRO: RetroArch will load the same preset for all games using a specific core
- CON: You can use ONE graphic pack for each core, meaning you can't have AMIGA 500 and AMIGA 1200 at the same time as they both work with PUAE core (see [folder preset loading](#443-folder-preset-loading) and [game preset loading](#444-game-preset-loading)).

To save your settings:
> - Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Save Core preset

ℹ️ *Note: Custom core preset are saved in the `/config/%CoreName%` folder in a `%CoreName%.slangp` file.*
  
  
### [4.4.3] FOLDER PRESET LOADING
*********************************

> I'd like to autoload the same preset for all games from a specific folder (i.e. `roms/Commodore - Amiga`)

- PRO: RetroArch will load the same preset for ALL the games in a specific folder. Usually this is the sweet spot to use more than one graphic pack on a multi-system core (i.e. for PUAE core I use three distinct folders for Amiga 500 floppies, Amiga 1200 hard drives and Amiga CD32 disks to apply separate AMIGA 500, AMIGA 1200 and AMIGA CD32 presets)
- CON: You can't have game-specific shader adjustments, most commons being overscan tuning (unless you use save separate core settings or go on with per-game presets, see [game preset loading](#444-game-preset-loading)).

To save your settings:
> - Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Save Content Directory preset

ℹ️ *Note: Custom directory preset are saved in the `/config/%CoreName%` folder in a `%FolderName%.slangp` file.*
  
  
### [4.4.4] GAME PRESET LOADING
*******************************

> I'd like to autoload a specific preset for a single game

- PRO: RetroArch will load a specific preset each time you boot a specific game. This way you can tune the shader settings to perfection, including position and overscan, for each game. You can also choose different graphic packs for each game.
- CON: You'll have to do this for every-single-game-you-love.

To save your settings:
> - Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Game preset

ℹ️ *Note: Custom game preset are saved in the `/config/%CoreName%` folder in a `%GameName%.slangp` file.*

[4.5] COMMON CUSTOMIZATIONS
---------------------------

This section contains some step-by-step examples of some of the most used customizations. For more information about shader parameters, please refer to the HSM Mega Bezel Reflection Shaders documentation.

### [4.5.1] CUSTOMIZE DISPLAY SCALING AND POSITIONING
*****************************************************

You can scale and position display and gameplay area (SMOOTH-ADV, ADV and STD profiles only).

> 1) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Shader Parameters
> 2) Go to the `SCALING` section
> 3) Use `NON-INTEGER SCALE %` to set display dimension
> 4) Go to the `POSITION OFFSET` section
> 5) Use `POSITION X` and `POSITION Y` parameters to set display position
> 6) Quick Menu -> Resume and enjoy your customized game

To save your custom settings:

> 7) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Save Shader preset as... -> give a name and save
> 8) (Next time you boot a game) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Load Shader Preset -> choose a preset

ℹ️ *Note: Custom preset are saved in the `/shaders` folder.*

### [4.5.2] CUSTOMIZE AMBIENT LIGHTNING
***************************************

You can tune the lightning level to obtain the best contrast between gaming area and backdrop:

> 1) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Shader Parameters
> 2) Go to the `NIGHT LIGHTNING` section
> 3) Use `OPACITY` value to set the amount of darkness
> 4) Quick Menu -> Resume and enjoy your customized game

To save your custom settings:

> 5) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Save Shader preset as... -> give a name and save
> 6) (Next time you boot a game) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Load Shader Preset -> choose a preset

ℹ️ *Note: Custom preset are saved in the `/shaders` folder.*

### [4.5.3] FIX OVERSCAN / PILLAR BOXES / BLACK AREAS
*****************************************************

You can make your old games go full screen by cutting away black areas:

> 1) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Shader Parameters
> 2) Go to the `CROPPING` section
> 3) Set `CROP MODE` to `CROP ANY`
> 4) Use `CROP TOP %`, `CROP BOTTOM %`, `CROP LEFT %` and `CROP RIGHT %` parameters to cut away pixels, image will adapt accordingly (try to keep a nice aspect ratio!)
> 5) Quick Menu -> Resume and enjoy your customized game

To save your game-specific settings:

> 6) Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save -> Game preset

ℹ️ *Note: Custom game preset are saved in the `/config/%CoreName%` folder in a `%GameName%.slangp` file.*

## How to update Mega Bezel Commodore Pack?
---

* I strongly recommend deleting any previously installed version of the pack before updating.
* Copy `shaders` folders from the Mega Bezel Commodore Pack archive you RetroArch root.

ℹ️ *Note: default files path is shaders/Mega_Bezel_Community/megabezel-commodore-pack

## How to uninstall Mega Bezel Commodore Pack?
---

* Delete `shaders/Mega_Bezel_Community/megabezel-commodore-pack` folder.
  
## Which CRT shader are presets based upon?
---

* `Guest-DrVenom` and NTSC variants.

## How to enable adaptive design?
---

* RetroArch v1.9.8 minimum required
* HSM Mega Bezel Reflection Shader V_0.9.106_2022-03-24_Rev_1 minimum required
* In RetroArch, Settings -> Video -> Scaling -> Aspect ratio set to ‘full’

## Everything looks funky and stretchy! What the hell is going on?
---

* In RetroArch, Settings -> Video -> Scaling -> Aspect ratio set to ‘full’
* In RetroArch, Quick Menu -> Shaders -> Save set 'Simple Presets' to ON
* Maybe you need to update RetroArch or HSM Mega Bezel Reflection Shader, look at minimum [software requirements](#31-software-requirements).
* Maybe you need a fresh start, look at the [installation](#32-installation) section.

## Can't see any preset in the shaders folder!
---

* You have to choose a `slangp` compatible video driver in your RetroArch settings
* Recommended video driver is `Vulkan`
* look at the 'Before you start' section

## Vulkan, gl or glcore? Which video driver is better?
---

* `Vulkan` is the king for performance
* `gl` and `glcore` may work, but require longer compilation times at start and suffer bad performance.
* Virtually any .slang capable driver may work, including: `Vulkan`, `gl`, `glcore`, `metal`, `Direct3D`, `WiiU`.
* Again, it's better for you to just use `Vulkan`. If your device doesn't support it, you need to update to something more performant.

## Can I make Mega Bezel Commodore Pack work with my ODroid, Raspberry Pi or Single Board Computer?
---

* Short answer: not yet.
* Long answer: Mega Bezel Reflection Shader enhancements can be intensive for GPU, the lack of drivers and computing firepower will determine a dramatic impact on framerate, compromising the gaming experience.
* Framework developer HyperSpaceMadness is fiddling with potato shaders and graphics caching optimizations: performance is constantly improving!

## Will you add new presets and systems to TheNamec Mega Bezel Commodore Pack?
---

* Currently I'm focusing on visual permutations for CRT TECHS (dot-mask, slot-mask, aperture grille, plasma), SIGNALS (RGB/SCART, S-VIDEO, COMPONENT, RF MODULATOR) and FLAVOURS (smooth, sharp, soft, more monochromes) 🤫
* Adding more Amiga, Commodore 64, VIC20 and Commodore 264 series variations and data units 🦾
* I'm pretty torn about pc-looking A1500, A2000, A3000, A4000... I'll take a look at these as soon as I complete the visual shaders overhaul 🤞

## Will you expand Mega Bezel packs to gaming systems other than Commodore?
---
* Only time will tell 😇 Free time and motivation are the key elements!
* Next steps include a whole new Bezeltron Display Series based upon holy grails of CRT-GAMING: PVMs and BVMs! 💪
* Duimon made an incredible effort with his Mega Bezel graphic project <https://forums.libretro.com/t/28146>
* Soqueroeu designed a pack of console-themed original TV Sets <https://forums.libretro.com/t/34301>
* Orionsangel focuses on game-themed arcade cabinets <https://forums.libretro.com/t/10604>

## Do you accept requests?
---

* Maybe yes. Do you have obscure Commodore devices you think I should add to the Mega Bezel Commodore Pack?

## Why did you make it only for 4K and 1080p, 16:9?
---

* My assets being pure vectors artwork, so I can virtually upscale it to infinite resolutions and dimensions... if I only had infinite RAM!
* Right now 4K and 1080p are a good compromise of file size, performance and quality.
* Support for adaptive design make TheNamec Mega Bezel Commodore Pack compatible for ultrawide and other-than-16:9 displays.
  
## What did you use to draw the artworks?
---

* A sperimental vector drawing application.
* A beated-up Logitech G-502 mouse. 
* No fancy graphic tablets were harmed during the process.
* Little to no raster post-production, except for 4K to 1080p supersampling.
